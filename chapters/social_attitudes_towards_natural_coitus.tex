\section*{Feminism and the World}

In recent times, the practice of natural coitus has come under scrutiny from both the powers that be, and a plethora of overzealous individuals who wish it torn asunder simply because it does not mesh with their solipsistic and outdated view of morality. This has happened partly because of how natural coitus comes across to many people, especially females and radical groups such as feminism. Feminism has sunk its jagged claws deep into the very fabric of our society, and, as such, commands a large amount of power and influence, especially among the female population and in politics.


Another reason for this rather expected turn of events is because the society of today has
become increasingly liberal to the point of caricature. The old ways and time-honored traditions
of natural coitus have becomes lost in a maelstrom of degenerate behavior as conservative
attitudes have been swept away through decades of gradual erosion. The caustic and unnatural
worldview that many women hold today directly correlates to the rise of feminism, which is itself
the bastard child of Cultural Marxism. Both have contributed heavily to the infamy and societal
persecution of those whose only wish is to practice the natural acts of coitus as was the norm in
the not-so-distant past of their forefathers. 


To illuminate and broaden our understanding of the subject, it must be mentioned that Feminist groups originally sprung from the Suffrage movement of the mid to late 1800s, with delusional women from all over Great Britain rising up against the superior males of the time.


Committing ludicrous acts such as chaining themselves to lamp posts (and being general nuisances in order to get their way, much like a child would to persuade their much wiser parents to buy them a toy they will soon forget about, and will then move on to wanting something else), the women gradually wore down opposition to their cause, and destroyed their detractors piecemeal. The men of the time, although well-versed in politics and the social sciences, had little idea of what they were up against or the kind of monster it would evolve into.


Like tantrum-throwing children, the women marched and demanded their rights, and, in stark contrast to the rhetoric of oppression they so actively preach these days, were given everything they demanded. Rights that should not have been theirs were granted, concessions made, time-honored traditions trampled, and new laws enacted, forcing the carefree male to enfeeble and socially castrate himself in order to fulll his most basic desire for sex (unless said male wished to be jailed for the newly-perpetrated transgressions). 


And that indeed is what has happened over the years, with the radical-like feminists standing in the way of the processes deemed natural by most experts in gender studies, including myself, along with other professionals of similar standing. Natural Coitus is, by itself, simply the process of bringing into the world the next generation of great men. It is a natural act, and the stigma associated with it is, from a historical point of view, a recent thing. What was natural and widely accepted only a hundred years ago has now been (to the detriment of us all) relegated to the realm of psychopathy.


Today, the Feminist movement is acting much like their Suffragette foremothers - in an
extremely aggressive manner not betting the valued, submissive woman. However, despite its
long string of victories over the course of decades, it is clear the movement has actually lost
momentum in recent years. Modern females may profess to it when among friends, and even live by its teachings, but, subconsciously, they crave the brutal, unyielding dominance of a superior male.
As the old proverb goes, a woman unchained is no woman at all! 
The blind solipsism and rabid misandry infecting the Feminists of today keeps them sequestered in a bubble of their own making, effectively barring them from realizing these self-evident truths. Women in the 1800s were ruled over by men, but they wanted this leadership, craved it, for supplication and submission to women is what war and natural coitus are to men. It was only when the Suffragettes came along and blinded the logical thinking of perfectly well-behaved females that they suddenly came to the radical and silly ideas they hold today, namely to involve themselves in things that only men understand and have made their spheres of influence since time immemorial.


Education, nance, politics, law enforcement... all bowed down and opened their doors to
the fairer sex, admitting women into the chambers of hallowed institutions which had been male-
oriented since their inception. Even the militaries of the developed world, those ancient work
horses of the nations which had defended their people through countless wars, have in many
countries, allowed females within their ranks.


Nowadays, the Feminists have run out of false oppressions to rail against and equalities to demand, and so they dedicate their time and energies to denouncing and shaming those who
would otherwise practice the most natural of processes, that which has, since the Neanderthals,
demonstrated who among a tribe was true Alpha.


First, let us define that word, as done so by Merriam-Webster:
\begin{quote}
 al•pha ('æl fe)
\\
 n., pl. -phas,\\
 adj. n.
\begin{enumerate}
       \item the first letter of the Greek alphabet (A, a).
       \item the first; beginning.
       \item (cap.) the brightest star in a constellation: Alpha Centauri.
       \item the first or foremost in a series of related items. 
\end{enumerate}
 adj.
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
       \item \begin{enumerate}
          \item  (esp. of animals) having the highest rank of its sex in a dominance hierarchy: the alpha female.
          \item  being the most prominent, talented, or aggressive person in a group: the alpha male of investment bankers.
       \end{enumerate}
       \item pertaining or linked to the carbon atom closest to a particular group in an organic molecule. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

Now, it has been proven that females prefer the 'Alphas' of society. Ask any female in
the street, and more than ninety percent of them will say they prefer a confident, attractive,
successful, and well-hung man. This is the most widely accepted definition of the characteristics
which, when they converge in one individual, make him an Alpha male. Therefore, it is glaringly
obvious that women are actually inviting Alphas to plant seeds inside their fertile wombs in
an effort to secure for themselves and their future progeny the best possible DNA. After all,
women are hypergamous, and it is socially acceptable (and encouraged) for them to seek the
42 best possible mates, even if they themselves do not come to scratching the upper echelons of female beauty (which is, in all honesty, the only metric of female value).



Returning to our earlier point, the only way of proving who is a dominant male is the process of natural coitus, for only the daring, strong, accomplished, and fearless man possesses the ingenuity and strength of character to attempt natural coitus at a time of history when all outside variables are pitted against him. In a time when automated labor and mechanized warfare have all but replaced the male in elds which had been his proving grounds for untold eons, one of the only ways (maybe the only way) a modern man can demonstrate his value to a female is to engage in natural coitus her. This enforces his dominance upon her, and visibly demonstrates his ability to subdue both her mind and her body to his will, and at great peril to himself! For, he chances life imprisonment if caught, and the inability to leverage his victory over the current female in future conquests even if he succeeds in performing natural coitus without suffering apprehension at the hands of the authorities.



In essence, what once was accepted and even celebrated is now shamed and maligned.
To nally weave all these threads together and put the whole picture into perspective, we must understand one nal part of the puzzle, and that is the undeniable fact that most females desire coitus, even if subconsciously. However, the majority of disenfranchised males today see feminism as a plague which has robbed them of their natural right to practice natural coitus.



This, then, leads them to conclusion that feminists, in their fight against Natural Coitus, are therefore stopping the human race from progressing, and, as such, should be removed or used for males to practice Natural Coitus on. However, while the latter is true, that former is not
entirely correct.



Those of us who study female behavior with a critical eye have come to understand that Feminism evolved out of a desire to test males. As already mentioned, there are few natural testing grounds left for a man living in the relative safety and comfort of the modern world, and the acquisition of wealth, while valuable to a female, does nothing to raise a man's status in her eyes if he is not possessed of physical stature, mental power, and dominance. And so, Feminism sprung into being, spawned in the darkest recesses of the female mind and nurtured from the percolating brine found therein to mature into its nal and current form - that which we witness today.



Its true purpose is to enforce a life of celibacy for the majority of helpless Beta males, while taunting and goading the most capable and ruthless Alphas to defy the law (and common sense) in order to fulfil their need for natural coitus. In a way, Feminism is the ultimate mating strategy, as it ensures a win-win scenario for women by eliminating the worthless individuals (via proxy, as their own shortcomings consign them to a life of labor and self-imposed celibacy) while pushing the worthwhile to excellence.



It can be said that Feminism is a brilliant, innately complex and self-deluding apparatus the female mind has enacted in order to receive the coitus they crave but eliminate the accompanying shame they do not desire.



Thus, Feminism serves as a mechanism which enables natural coitus of the highest caliber. In its purest form, feminism is the vehicle of the very essence natural coitus.
